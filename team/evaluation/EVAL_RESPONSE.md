# Own `USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md`

1. The other team's main feedback was positive towards our user profile, way of saving songs, and ranking algorithm. There were definitely some bugs that can be fixed (the profile screen wasn't showing up for a couple of them), but overall, the feedback was positive.
2. The main feedback from the other team regarded the confusion with how our ranking system places the numerical value to each song. They wanted to add more categories outside of 'Good', 'Ok', and 'Bad', and wanted more explanation on how the ranking system was calculated. Maybe we can add a tooltip to make sure there isn't much confusion with our application!
3. The feedback towards our UI was defniitely mixed. There's a lot of bugs with our UI, with some people not having the profile screen shot up altogether. These bugs are definitely urgent issues that we need to fix. Additionally, the UI isn't as intuitive as some people would have liked (what does the heart button do?). They recommended we add more text, descriptions, info popups, etc... to make our app more clear (especially towards the ranking system and small buttons throughout our app).

# Feature Summary

Overall, the other team thought that our product was mainly:

- A social media platform to help users rank their favorite songs and view their friends' ranking of songs.
- They enjoyed the ranking system and intuitiveness of our application, but definitely pointed out some improvements we could do. The majority of the improvements resided in the frontend, mainly coming from user confusion on the flow of our app.

# Project Intuitive-ness

- The general consensus was that the app was intuitive, but could highly benefit from having more tooltips, descriptions, and helpers to guide the user throughout the follow. The main concerns with the intuitiveness of our app resided in small UI comments here and there, as well as unexplained features of our app (how to actually add a song). We will take these comments into consideration and hope to improve the UI before the code freeze!

# How the other team was able to follow the deployment

The other team definitely struggled a bit in the deployment, and the lack of clarity was definitely on us. We could / should make our DEPLOYMENT.md file a lot more clear and hash out the deployment steps to reduce the number of user actions. There were a lot of keys and packages the user had to change / install which could have been solved with a simple requirements.txt file.

# Closing Thoughts:

1. Like: Clean UI! Good designs.
2. Most Impactful: Better UX -- unclear instructions for certain features
3. Good: Ranking system was innovative and cool!
