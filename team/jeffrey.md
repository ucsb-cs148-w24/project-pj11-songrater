# Ideas
1. With the app, users can add albums / songs to their collection and individually rank them. This will keep track of a user's favorite album's / songs

2. Through a user's ranking of albums / songs, the application will automatically set ratings on a 0.0 - 10.0 scale. This hopefully removes bias / subjectivity in setting direct decimal numbers for ratings.

3. A user can lookup other friends and view their rankings as well. From this social feature, more features like song recommendations based on their current ratings, similarity scores between users, and prediction scores for other albums.
