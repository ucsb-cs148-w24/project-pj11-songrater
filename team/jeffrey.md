Brief Ideas: 
1) Similar to the app Beli, users can personally rank albums / songs they've listened to. 

2) Given user rankings, the app will automatically generate ratings / a ranking system for a user

3) A user can search for other friends and view their rankings. Through this social feature, a user could get recommendations for other songs/albums, predicitions on how much they like the song/album, and a similarity score between the user and their friend.
