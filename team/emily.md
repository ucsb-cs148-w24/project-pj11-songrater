# Description

Hi, I'm Emily, I'm a 3rd year computer science student. 

# Ideas for the project

Some ideas I have include: 

Once enough song rankings have been stored, the app can recommend new songs/albums/artists.
Once the app for one platform has been made (mobile/web app), we can make it work on the other platform.
Users can see the type of music they like listening to, and analyze things like song tempo, mood, etc.
