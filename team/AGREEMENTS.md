1. If someone is absent: making sure they see the notes recorded in the daily scrum meetings, knowing what tasks/issues they have been assigned, and checking for any activity taking place on Slack and message

2. We will try to be present for as many sessions (lectures/discussion sections) as possible throughout the quarter

3. We will look to support each other as a team (like making responsible team goals, getting advice from others who have technical expertise in some area/domain, etc.)
