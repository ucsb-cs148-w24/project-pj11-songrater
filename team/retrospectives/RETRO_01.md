# Date of Retrospective: 01/26/24

* Led by: Aryaman Das
* Present: Aryaman, Emily, Leyang, Amy, Collin, Jeffrey, Katya
* Absent: N/A

## Action items

* a goal: Work more on the project outside of class
* a change: Establish a time for working together outside of class. Doesn't have to be together in person, but just a time where everyone is working.
* a measurement: We can be in a discord call together for easier communication but also a lot of freedom to do whatever is individually necessary.
  
* a goal: Manage absences effectively.
* a change: When people are absent, they will be able to catch up more easily, and work still gets done.
* a measurement: When people are absent, they should write a blurb about what they did, as well as read meeting notes.

* a goal: Make class times more structured and useful.
* a change: Create a routine, ie: as soon as the professor is done talking, we scrum. After, we work on tasks for the lab and the project as a whole.
* a measurement: We can keep track of how often we scrum and our efficiency in moving on through time.

## Optional

* Start creating tasks that are more fine-grained (ie. divide an issue into sub-issues if possible) so that there is always something for everyone to work on
* Add checkbox requirements in the description of github issues so that each person(s) knows exactly what needs to be accomplished (they can have some sort of checklist to follow and verify)
* If you find anything useful online for learning a particular backend/frontend framework, put that link to the resource on our discord channel so that everyone can learn/benefit from it

## Retro Assessment

* We used the start/stop/continue retro template to frame our retrospective discussion, where everyone was given a chance to elaborate on the start/stop/continue points
* It went pretty well. Everyone got a chance to participate in the discussion and overall we were able to do a deep introspection into ourselves in terms of what we have been doing well as a team and what we can do to improve/enhance the work+learning experience
* One advice I would give is in order to make the retrospective substantial (in terms of quality of discussion and length of time), you should encourage each and every member in the team to speak their mind out so that there can be a fruitful discussion about various things, which will inevitably result in some sort of introspection taking place and thus help us as a team going forward. Also there is no need to change the retro template: start/stop/continue works just fine!

## Retro Records

1. Start working in groups more
2. Start reading all the notes if absent
3. Start using communication tools more 
4. Stop making big issues
5. Continue posting resources 


## Experiment/Change
Updated Jan 31

* Putting lab checklist in issues for organization
* We believe the first retro was successful because it helped us save time and start the development of the project because we could assign each other issues to tackle individually
* We will keep the change
