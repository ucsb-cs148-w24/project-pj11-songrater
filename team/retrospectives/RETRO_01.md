# Date of Retrospective: 01/26/24

* Led by: Aryaman Das
* Present: Aryaman, Emily, Leyang, Amy, Collin, Jeffrey, Katya
* Absent: N/A

## Action items

* a goal: Work more on the project outside of class
* a change: Establish a time for working together outside of class. Doesn't have to be together in person, but just a time where everyone is working.
* a measurement: We can be in a discord call together for easier communication but also a lot of freedom to do whatever is individually necessary.
  
* a goal: Manage absences effectively.
* a change: When people are absent, they will be able to catch up more easily, and work still gets done.
* a measurement: When people are absent, they should write a blurb about what they did, as well as read meeting notes.

* a goal: Make class times more structured and useful.
* a change: Create a routine, ie: as soon as the professor is done talking, we scrum. After, we work on tasks for the lab and the project as a whole.
* a measurement: We can keep track of how often we scrum and our efficiency in moving on through time.

## Optional

* Start creating tasks that are more fine-grained (ie. divide an issue into sub-issues if possible) so that there is always something for everyone to work on
* Add checkbox requirements in the description of github issues so that each person(s) knows exactly what needs to be accomplished (they can have some sort of checklist to follow and verify)
* If you find anything useful online for learning a particular backend/frontend framework, put that link to the resource on our discord channel so that everyone can learn/benefit from it
