# Date of Retrospective: 02/21/24

* Led by: Katya 
* Present: Aryaman, Emily, Leyang, Amy, Collin, Jeffrey, Aryaman
* Absent: N/A

## Action items

* a goal: Improve the efficiency when working during class time 
* a change: Setting up the templates documents on git before scrum/or sprint to reduce the time cost; Assigning roles before each scrum/retro
* a measurement: We can apply these methods before next class and see how long the next scrum takes 
  

* a goal: Stop distributing the class time inefficiently 
* a change: During class time, assign tasks for the week and set up meeting time in subgroups; 
* a measurement: We can keep track of how often we scrum and our efficiency in moving on through time.

## Optional

* Start creating tasks that are more fine-grained (ie. divide an issue into sub-issues if possible) so that there is always something for everyone to work on
* Add checkbox requirements in the description of github issues so that each person(s) knows exactly what needs to be accomplished (they can have some sort of checklist to follow and verify)
* If you find anything useful online for learning a particular backend/frontend framework, put that link to the resource on our discord channel so that everyone can learn/benefit from it

## Retro Assessment
* We used the "start/stop/continue" template, allowing all team members to contribute to discussions on what to start, stop, and continue doing.
   
* The retro went well, with active participation and effective introspection, leading to a better understanding of team dynamics and areas for improvement.

* Encourage every team member to express their thoughts openly quality discussion.

## Retro Records

### Start
1. Start setting up the templates documents on git beforehand  
2. Start assigning roles before each scrum/retro

### Continue
1. Continue working in groups more
2. Continue seperating the issues in frontend and backend
3. Continue communicating with others
4. Continue posting resources on discord

### Stop 
1. Stop distributing the class time inefficiently 



## Experiment/Change
Updated Feb 23

* Started working on the template for scrum meetings 
* We believe the second retro was successful because it helped us save time during class (and lab); Scrum went well and took less time 
* We will keep the change
