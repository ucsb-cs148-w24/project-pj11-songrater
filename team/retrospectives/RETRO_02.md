# Date of Retrospective: 02/21/24

* Led by: Katya 
* Present: Aryaman, Emily, Leyang, Amy, Collin, Jeffrey, Aryaman
* Absent: N/A

## Action items

* a goal: Work more on the project outside of class
* a change: Establish a time for working together outside of class. Doesn't have to be together in person, but just a time where everyone is working.
* a measurement: We can be in a discord call together for easier communication but also a lot of freedom to do whatever is individually necessary.
  
* a goal: Manage absences effectively.
* a change: When people are absent, they will be able to catch up more easily, and work still gets done.
* a measurement: When people are absent, they should write a blurb about what they did, as well as read meeting notes.

* a goal: Stop distributing the class time inefficiently 
* a change: During class time, assign tasks for the week and set up meeting time in subgroups; 
* a measurement: We can keep track of how often we scrum and our efficiency in moving on through time.

## Optional

* Start creating tasks that are more fine-grained (ie. divide an issue into sub-issues if possible) so that there is always something for everyone to work on
* Add checkbox requirements in the description of github issues so that each person(s) knows exactly what needs to be accomplished (they can have some sort of checklist to follow and verify)
* If you find anything useful online for learning a particular backend/frontend framework, put that link to the resource on our discord channel so that everyone can learn/benefit from it

## Retro Assessment
* We used the "start/stop/continue" template, allowing all team members to contribute to discussions on what to start, stop, and continue doing.
   
* The retro went well, with active participation and effective introspection, leading to a better understanding of team dynamics and areas for improvement.

* Encourage every team member to express their thoughts openly quality discussion.

## Retro Records

### Start
1. Start setting up the templates documents on git beforehand  
2. Start assigning roles before each scrum/retro

### Continue
1. Continue working in groups more
2. Continue seperating the issues in frontend and backend
3. Continue communicating with others
4. Continue posting resources on discord

### Stop 
1. Stop distributing the class time inefficiently 



## Experiment/Change
Updated Jan 31

* Putting lab checklist in issues for organization
* We believe the first retro was successful because it helped us save time and start the development of the project because we could assign each other issues to tackle individually
* We will keep the change
