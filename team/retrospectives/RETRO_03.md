# Date of Retrospective: 03/08/24

- Led by: Amy
- Present: Aryaman, Emily, Leyang, Katya, Collin, Jeffrey, Aryaman
- Absent: N/A

## Action items

- a goal: Detailed calendar and goals before the code freeze.
- a change: Setting up a when2meet and google calendar tasks/deadlines to make sure everything is accounted for before 03/15
- a measurement: Determine m/n tasks completed where n := total tasks due and m := total tasks completed.
- a goal: Stop distributing the class time inefficiently
- a change: During class time, assign tasks for the week and set up meeting time in subgroups;
- a measurement: We can keep track of how often we scrum and our efficiency in moving on through time.

## Optional

- Take proactive steps to schedule regular check-ins with TAs to discuss progress, challenges, and get feedback. Even if you're unsure of what specific help you need, TAs can provide guidance, suggest improvements, and help refine your approach.
- Make a concerted effort to schedule and prioritize regular team meetings, possibly using Doodle polls or similar tools to find common times that work for everyone.

## Retro Assessment

- We used the "4 L's: Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed-For" template, allowing all team members to contribute to discussions on what to start, stop, and continue doing.
- The retro went great! There was a lot of participation and the change in format made it seem new. This led to a better understanding of team dynamics and areas for improvement.

- If I were to give advice for the next person leading a retro, I would emphasize the importance of carefully listening to the discussion and making sure each team member is heard and appreciated.

## Retro Records

Liked:

- All of the puzzle pieces are slowly coming together
- Like the frontend and the UI; feels very cohesive
- Liked the teamwork and the paired programming going along.

Learned:

- Do not like excessive documentation.
- Components can't start with a lower case letter
- Threading is really good practice for backend
- Be more resourceful; stack overflow was very helpful. Also, checking compatibility before coding.
- Frontend and backend skills are becoming a lot more polished. Database skills are also learning.

Lacked:

- We lacked time
- Urgency during midterm season; a couple of days were no progress was made
- More parallelism in our project group (everyone was kinda working on the same thing)
- More fine-grained tasks that are easily implementable.

Longed-For:

- Our app to be even better
- Friend functionality (actual social media aspect of everything)
- Use the TAs more, but not sure what we could use them for.
- Long for more time when we can meet as a group.
