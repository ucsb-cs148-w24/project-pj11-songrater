## Plans for improving certain skills/learning from scratch

Aryaman Das - Focus on learning the nuances of Flask (like syntax for setting up the API handlers) in week 3, start learning React native from week 4

Jeffrey Mun - Look into component libraries from the frontend and ways to bypass rate-limiting from API calls.

Amy Wang - Plan to improve javascript skills with practice and reading through documentation. Will watch tutorials on hard to understand topics. Focus on understanding Flask

Emily Hu - Watch youtube videos on how to set up databases and API calls. Brush up on javascript skills for the frontend.

Collin Qian - Focus on learning more React Native principles and also help setting up the database. I will do this with tutorials

Leyang Ni - Learn javascript skills and React Native/ review and learn databases management

Katyayani Raman - Learn more about frontend (CSS and HTML) as well as backend.
