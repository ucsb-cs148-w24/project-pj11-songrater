### 2 Questions:
1. What have you been up to, for this project and otherwise?
2. What are you planning to get done for the rest of the week?

### Team Responses:

Katya:
1. Busy with other classes
2. Can work on the other endpoint; Will work on the add user and search user endpoints

Amy:
1. Was able to suppress warnings for Poppins. There was a bug in the code which prevented us from loading fonts. Also worked on the errors for virtualize-list; cannot use it with our containers.
2. Finalize the flow of the app -- UI changes are very subjective and thinks it's more important to work on the app structure. Want to also work on small things on the search page.

Emily:
1. Got the main functionality of the profile page; doesn't know how to get the user, but it's correctly updated with the backend data.
2. Wants to finish the CRUD operations for user profiles. 

Aryaman:
1. Just finishing the endpoint for users and user list; making sure he's testing it and everything works as expected.
2. Same as above ^, continuing and finishing.

Leyang:
1. Updated the Figma with a friend's page and a workflow to click with a friend's profile
2. Working on the friends feature and that implementation

Jeffery:
1. Also modified the api endpoints to store song information, and got the data to show up properly on the full-stack side
2. Fixing up the state management with the algorithm

Collin:
1. Finished auth on the frontend and connected it with the flask endpoint. Also added sign in with Google. 
2. Needs to connect login pages with Amy's web API
