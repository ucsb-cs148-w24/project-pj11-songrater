### Team Responses:

Katya:
1. Nothing much ,busy with another class. 
2. Busy with another class. 

Amy:
1. Looked over Collin's code and the feedback from Monday. Did some small changes. 
2. Nothing really. Just life.

Emily:
1. Working on the profile page and the edit profile page. Finding difficulties getting the modal to show up.
2. React native difficulties; infamiliarity with the codebase. 

Aryaman:
1. Finished all of the necessary endpoints for the application. Most of the basic ones are done, and they are pushed up. 
2. Same as above ^, continuing and finishing.

Leyang:
1. Made the friends page (really simple) and connected it to the endpoints. 
2. Unfamiliarity with making functions with react native and connecting with an endpoint. 

Jeffery:
1. Fully completed merging with Aryaman's branch, finished rate song and search song screens to work with new endpoints. Working on algorithm. Also did the EVAL_RESPONSE doc.
2. Database indexing starts at 1, but javascript indexing starts at 0. Once that is fixed up, it should be good.

Collin:
1. Leyang and collin finished the friends screen. Merged it with Amy's so now there are sign in / sign up.
2. Nothing really stopping them now. Just needs to merge the code.
