## Reflections

### How useful this tool was / potentially could be for your coding effort going forward? 

__Leyang__ -- This tool was super useful by giving valuable suggestiongs from how to fix bugs in specific codes to the overall process of how to generate a recommendation system. 



### What steps you needed to (or couldnâ€™t) take to ensure that the AI output was correct, understandable, and fair use

__Leyang__ -- I think it depends on what questions ChatGPT answers. If it is a certain conding task, after getting results from ChatGPT, we need to immediately test the code to see if it works. If it is a general suggestions such as how to generate amusic recommendation system, then we need to look for other resources, especially the experiences from people who have done that before, to check if the suggestions are applicable.
