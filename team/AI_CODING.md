## AI tools

__Leyang__ -- Used ChatGPT to explore how to generate a music recommendation system. 

__Collin__ -- Used Cursor to identify errors in my code and fix them. Cursor was very helpful in generating recommended code as well.

## Outcomes

__Leyang__ -- Got an overview of the whole process: Data Collection, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Build User              Profilesm, Model Training, Evaluation, Deployment, Monitoring and Iteration. 

__Collin__ -- Was able to make progress on my code and fix errors that I was having trouble with. Specifically with user authentication in Auth0.

## Reflections

### How useful this tool was / potentially could be for your coding effort going forward? 

__Leyang__ -- This tool was super useful by giving valuable suggestiongs from how to fix bugs in specific codes to the overall process of how to generate a recommendation system. 

__Collin__ -- Tool is super useful as it makes coding much less frustrating. Since it has your entire code base as context, it is able to generate accurate advice and the code is usually correct.

### What steps you needed to (or couldnâ€™t) take to ensure that the AI output was correct, understandable, and fair use

__Leyang__ -- I think it depends on what questions ChatGPT answers. If it is a certain conding task, after getting results from ChatGPT, we need to immediately test the code to see if it works. If it is a general suggestions such as how to generate amusic recommendation system, then we need to look for other resources, especially the experiences from people who have done that before, to check if the suggestions are applicable. 

__Collin__ -- I would test the AI's code by looking through its logic witih my own eyes and running it in my local environment and seeing if it works. In general, the chat feature with Cursor explains the code it produces very well too, so having the chat to break down specific parts of the code and reason it with logic makes it much easier to understand as well.
