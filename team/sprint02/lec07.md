## 2 Questions:
1.) What do you	hope to	do before the MVP deadline?
2.) How	do you want to get the MVP video done?



Amy: Before teh MVP deeadline, she wants tehre to be a product. So jopefully the frontend is mostly finished (have a draft). She is going to work on the searchbar implementation.
2.) For the video, she is able to meet in person and work on it.

Aryaman:

1.) For the MVP: get backend features done. There are two main ones (if a user clicks on a song and lsitens to it, he should be able to rank it). He should be asked whether it is a good, bad or okay song. And then when he proesses one of thos ethree options he should see the current list of songs for that category. HEcan use that inforamtion to rank it. Esentially, there should be another page where teh user can see the song. There is three main pieces of information (whehe the song is good, abd or okay).. All of this is fed to an endpoint in the flask server which interfaces with the databse and uses this information.
2.) Meeting up in person would be the easiest.

Colin:

1.) Have been working on the user authentication. A lto more work if done manuaulyl so he's trying to get the auth0 on e to work as well. What eh wants to be done before teh deadline is not the user authentication but rather something else as this isn't the highest priority for the MVP. 
2.) A zoom call would be the easiest way to get the video done, but in person works just as well.

Emily:

1.) Decided that we could use a B tree and that would scale the best. Check out the rebase. Did a little bit of editing into the flask page to make it so that you can couple your database with the flask backend. She hopes to help with the frontend.
2.) A zoom call would be a good idea because we can record the screen, but in person also works.

Jeffrey:

1.) Before the MVP deadline: workign wither amy or collin on the actual ranking funcitonality. also working on the discog api and improving the frontend.
Add song and rate song.
2.) Down to do it in person on Thursday.

Katya:


Leyang:

1.) Before teh MVP: make sure the database is working (b-tree indexes are working correctly). This needs different features to be done before that. Finish the ranking list.
2.) Would prefer zoom because it is easier to record.
