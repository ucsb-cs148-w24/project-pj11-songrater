Amy:

1. Also participated in SBHacks, had a good time.
2. Amy personally had a lot of trouble describing her music taste when people ask. She thinks it'd be cool if a user can see what their music taste looks like and share/compare with friends. She also likes the idea of ratings.

1. Also participated in SBHacks, had a great time.

2. Wants a way to easily answer the question: what kind of music do you listen to. Likes the idea of rating / keeping track of general genres.

Katya:

1. Got dinner with some friends this weekend!
2. Gamepigeon, send an album or song in a gamepigeon-esque format where a friend can rate / comment on the song. Also likes the idea of making casette / song collections for friends and wants to bring that into digital.
