# Lab02

Assigned: Friday, 1/19/2024
Due: Friday, 1/26/2024

## Scrum

Present: Emily, Aryaman, Amy, Leyang, Jeffrey
Absent: Collin, Katya

### 2 Questions:

1. What do you think we should do next week
2. What is your biggest concern

### Team Responses:

Leyang

1. By next week, decide on doing a web app vs mobile app first. There's no detailed plan, but at least be at a place where we have some original code.
2. Not much experience with react or react native. Feels pressured to learn so much in such a short amount of time.

Jeffrey

1. Need to choose between web vs mobile. We can use CSS to style for different screens, but for early development, optimizing screen sizes should be low on the priority list. Also should have an agreed upon MVP where each team member is happy.
2. Each person has different skillsets, hard to choose a middle ground. Additionally, finding clarity on our app direction is hard as what can we solve that other apps cannot. Constricted by time because lectures / sections don't give too much time on development, and 2 team members aren't here, so we can't really work on an MVP this section as vision will probably change next week.

Amy

1. Need an MVP by next week so that we can start as soon as possible. Also want team to agree on the vision for the app and the vibe. Also want some team division / organized plan on tackling the app development.
2. Distribution of responsibilities so that each person is up to date.

Emily

1. Start writing something. Doesn't have to be the best, but at least start somewhere.
2. Time constraint and making sure that everyone is on the same page on how everything should look. There will be conflict, and on the front-end side, concern about merges.

Aryaman

1. Familiar with the KanBan board and understanding of the user stories / assignments. And we want to officially start on the project.
2. Time managing part of it; not enough time in class. Cooperate with each other to ensure that each person also distributes the work easily.

## Action Items

1. Sprint planning meeting
2. Assign an issue

- By Friday Jan 26th, the issue should be moved from To-Do to In-Progress to Done

3. Update README.md file
4. At least one user story in the in-progress or Done
5. At least one issue under each user story that will direct the implementation of the user story
6. Each team member should be assigned to at least 1 issue in the in-progress colun

- Issues can either be individuals, pairs, etc...

## Notes

For today, put all of our user stories onto the kanban board.

Next monday, decide on tech stack, write READMe, and assign issues.
