# Lab01

Assigned: Friday, 1/12/2024
Due: Friday, 1/19/2024

## Details:

Each person needs to create a branch, make a file in team/`your_first_name.md`, and create a pull request

- Do we only create the PR? Or do we also merge it into main
- Is there only a single person who is writing these notes? Should we use an external platform and import it into a `.md` file when we're done?

## Norms:

- Notes for Norms placed in `teams/norms.md`

## Milestone 1

- For the first 10 minutes of class, we made sure each team member was able to complete Milestone1.
- We wanted to get this checked, but there were a lot of issues with the github repository. The github repository was not set up for our class, thus we were not able to complete our task.
- Thus, we all agreed to finish Milestone 1 by lecture on Wednesday
