# Introduction
Aryaman Das, 4th year CS major. My favorite programming language is Java, and in my free time, I like to try out new restaurants, visit beaches, and work out in the gym.

# Ideas
1. Recommend songs/albums to user based on preferences like artist and genre

2. Create a more sophisticated recommendation system where it not only takes into account the rating that the user gives, but also the feedback (review) that the user provides to a song/album. The idea is that the user can fill out a multiple choice questionaire where he/she will have a list of options to choose from indicating why he/she gave that particular rating (the lyrics were great, bgm was so-so, etc.). User can select multiple such options, and based on that specific feedback, recommend songs/albumsprecisely representing his/her interests/music tastes.
