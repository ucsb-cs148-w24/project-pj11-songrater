# User Journey

1. As a user I can rate my music so that other people can see it
2. As a friend I can rate my friend's music
3. As an artist, I can see how my music is doing.
4. As a user, I can get a breakdown of my music taste so that I can properly answer, "what kind of music do you listen to"
5. As a user, I can get recommendations for new songs based on my other songs so that I can find new music.
6. As a user, I can see how old songs match up to new songs so that I can keep a record of my music history.
7. As a user, I can use my listening history on Spotify to easily add new songs so that I don't have to look up each individual song.
