__User Roles__

Our song rater app has two kinds of users: One is the general user browsing/ranking songs, and the other is the artist who releases their songs/albums.

Users can do the following:
1. Perform basic CRUD operations (add themselves as a user in the app, delete their profile, etc.)
2. Users can rank a song, which will then be added to their music (listening) history
3. Users can look up user profiles of their friends, and rank their songs too (seeing their music tastes as well as your own)
4. For later: Users can get recommendations of new songs based on their current music tastes

Artist can do the following:
1. See how their music is doing (which songs have been viewed the most, ranked the highest, etc.)
