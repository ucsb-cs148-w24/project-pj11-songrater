## Features and Operation

### Sharing Songs

With Melo, sharing your newly discovered songs with friends is easy. With a landing page that shows your your friends' feeds, users can quickly and easily catch up with their friend's opinions of new songs and potentialyl give those songs a listen as well! Melo makes sharing music a center piece of our app and easier than ever.


### Ranking Songs

Has anyone ever asked you what your favorite song is? Or what songs you'd want to recommend? It can be difficult to come up with an answer on the spot, no matter how much you like music. With Melo, we help people come up with a ranked song list so that users can answer those questions easily. By using a head-to-head ranking system, users are guided through the process of creating a list, without having to arbitrarily guess at what they might rate a song out of 10.

### Song Ratings

Rating a song out of ten can be difficult, especially if a list of songs is rated at different times, and ratings can depend on mood and other circumstances. Because our ranking system prodocues a clearly ordered list, ratings can be precicely calculated. Having a rating is important because a song's ranking depends on how many songs a user has ranked, so a song ranked 5th out of 100 is much more highly ranked than a song ranked 5th out of 10. By providing users with song rating, it is easier for users to compare opinions and gives users a number to share with people not using Melo.

### Social Interactions

With Melo, it is easy to add friends and check out their profiles. Compare your tastes with your frieds'. Melo's lists could serve as a good jumping off point for group playlists, deciding on new albums to try, etc.

### User Profile and Settings

Under user profiles, users can scroll through a list of songs that they've rated before and look back at their list. Users can look at the list and answer questions like: "What's your all time favorite song?", as well as potentially rediscover old favorites that they've perhaps forgotten about with time.
