# Deployment

Our project is a mobile app built using React Native and Expo. Deployment requires Expo, which can deploy the app as either a web app or onto a phone, which is how we plan to demo our app.

Once the required libraries are installed, the app can be exployed through expo by running: npx expo start, and following the instructions in the command line, which will likely involve scanning the QR code provided by Expo.
